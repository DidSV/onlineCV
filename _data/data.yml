    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a QA Engineer with 3+ years experience in Testing. For certain time 
      (about 1,5 year) I was a QA Lead of the QA Department in my previous company (Devlight).
      Then I’ve switched to the biggest IT company in Ukraine – SoftServe.  I pay a lot of attention
      to the quality of the product testing and processes of testing. I have high personal standards
      and attention to details. My last project entered to the Google`s top of three best apps ("Nova Poshta")
      in Ukraine. Also my last project was a professional graphic editing tool for vector and raster graphics
      from the market leaders in this area. I helped them to release that soft on both most popular OS’s – MacOS and Windows.
      I always try to do my work as perfect as it could be. I try to use Agile and Design thinking methodologies
      in all my projects, because I believe that the best product is that one that people not only need use, but they
      love to use it every day. I believe that only  methodical and strategic approaches for the work can make good products
      really great.
